Minimum Spanning Tree


-> Tree
A tree is a connected graph in which no cycles are present (Can be simply called an undirected acyclic connected graph). 
An important property of a tree is that every pair of nodes in a tree has exactly one path between them.


-> Spanning Tree

Given a connected graph G, a spanning tree is a tree whose vertex set is exactly same as that of G 
and edge set is a subset (may be equal) of that of G. 
Informally speaking, a spanning tree is a tree T formed by deleting some edges of G 
but preserving the fact that every two nodes in original graph have a path between them in T also.

-* n nodes and n-1 edges and all nodes are reachable from each other
-* A graph can have multiple spanning trees


-> Minimum Spanning Tree

The spanning tree having the minimum cost (Sum of all edges) amongst all the spanning trees of the graph is the MST.


Algorithms (MST) :
1. Prim's Algorithm
2. Kruskal's Algorithm
